## Polish Poetry

After studying Polish Literature and Language, I figured a smart and motivating idea for a CRUD app would be to create a sort-of online Polish Poetry Anthology.

Determining the routes and the movement of the site would be integral to determining the functionality of this idea.

This website is both education and interactive!

## Technologies Used

This CRUD app was created with HTML5, CSS3, Python, Django, AWS (for image storage/s3) and ultimately deployed on Heroku.

## Getting Started

The app is hosted on Heroku and is acccessible through this [Polish Poetry](https://polishpoetry.herokuapp.com/) link. 

As stated above, the object of the projecy is to empty an app where the data was CRUD-able, these are all incorporated in many facets of my app.

## Next Steps

* I could add a polish translated version/link a translate API.

* I can add favorites for users.

* Augment the flexibility of adding poems, poets, collections.

* Create a more robust/optional form for the poets.

* Incorporate a search bar and a poem of the day to the homepage.

* Lastly, learn how to manipulate widgets for placeholder text.
